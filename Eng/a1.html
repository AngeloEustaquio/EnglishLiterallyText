<h1>Chapter I: The beginning of a Dream</h1>
<article class="article">
<section><b>July 2, 1880,</b> In the city of Manila, there was a neighborhood called Bagumbayan, now known as Rizal Park or Luneta. A handsome and noble boy named Manuel Ibarra was born. Manuel’s family was not that well-off, living hand-to-mouth.</section>
<section>His mother’s name was Maria dela Cruz, a housewife, and his father was Antonio Ibarra, a telegram messenger. Therefore, Manuel needed to work to help his parents. Manuel felt the hardships of life at a young age, doing various types of work such as cutting grass, begging in front of the chapel, carpentry, and fishing.</section>
<section>Manuel’s father was also a writer, and because of this, Manuel learned how to write. His talent in the art of writing was undeniably excellent. With a pen and paper, he could create songs that would surely impress people.</section>
<section>It was not long before his aunt noticed his skill in writing, and she offered Manuel to go to Intramuros to study in college. In exchange, Manuel would teach his cousins to read. Manuel immediately accepted the offer, knowing that he would have more opportunities if he could attend college.</section>
<section>At the age of fourteen, Manuel became a full-fledged poet. He was given the nickname Kiko, usually given to poets. Manuel found time to read various works created by talented poets such as Jose Rizal, Francisco Balagtas, and Juan Luna.</section>
