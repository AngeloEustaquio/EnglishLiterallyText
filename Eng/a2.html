          <section>The books *Florante at Laura*, *Noli Me Tangere*, and many others inspired him to improve his writing.</section>
          <section>In the year <b>1896</b>, Manuel studied Castilian at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran. There he met the first woman who captured his heart—Felecita Trinidad del Buente Deguzman, daughter of a wealthy family. Her parents were Spaniards named Don Fernando Deguzman and Doña Juana Trinidad del Buente, both merchants.</section>
          <section>Felecita was a woman who, despite growing up in wealth, understood those around her. Her course of study was grammar.</section>
          <section>Little by little, Manuel became known in the fields of poetry, plays, and *balagtasan*. Not only within their university but also in the town of Intramuros, he was always the talk of the young women. He was also the one who always recited poems to represent their university. Because of this, many people grew envious of him, and it was no longer unusual for Manuel to get into fights due to the successes he had achieved.</section>
          <section>Manuel joined *La Liga Matrikula*, whose goal was to provide scholarships to young people with talent. Here, Manuel proposed that the youth should be given proper education in reading and writing. He tried to pass this on to the government so his voice would be heard. However, the government did not agree, reasoning that the country no longer had the funds to provide scholarships for the youth.</section>
          <section>But Manuel found that reasoning unbelievable, for he knew of the shadows of power lurking within politics.</section>
